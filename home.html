    <p2>About </p2>

    <p4><br /><br />The College Hackathon<br /></p4>

    <p3
    ><br />In the context of a hackathon, the word "hack" is used to
        describe how multiple technologies can be used<br />together in a new
        and innovative way. Teams of up to four people spend the weekend working
        on<br />innovative software and hardware solutions to real-world
        problems. These projects range in platform and<br />application,
        including elements of web development, mobile applications, drones, and
        more. However,<br />many times the most important aspect of a hackathon
        is the community it generates and skills that<br />inexperienced hackers
        walk away with.<br
        /></p3>

    <p4><br />The PennApps Difference<br /></p4>

    <p3
    ><br />Founded in the fall of 2009, PennApps was the nation's first
        student-run college hackathon. Since then, it<br />has spurred a
        revolution in the way engineering students develop and showcase their
        skills, spawning an<br />entire "league" of hackathons across the
        nation. In past years, over a thousand students from the U.S. and<br />other
        countries like Switzerland, Canada, England, and Singapore have
        converged in Philadelphia for the<br />spring and fall editions of the
        event for a weekend of creation and discovery. Both beginners and
        experts<br />alike will work together, learn and compete to become
        better engineers and work on awesome projects.<br />This year, PennApps
        is expanding its focus on learning by emphasizing the collaboration of
        new and<br />experienced hackers, and providing more learning
        opportunities and workshops throughout the weekend.<br /><br
        /></p3>

    <p4><br /><br />The Application Process<br /></p4>

    <p3
    ><br />Thousands of qualified candidates apply to participate in
        PennApps every year, however our space can<br />only support a limited
        number of participants and as much as we'd like to take everyone, it
        just isn't<br />possible. We think that the fairest way to decide who we
        invite is by asking everyone to tell us a little bit<br />about
        themselves, so that we can invite people who have demonstrated interest
        and skill.<br /><br />
        We don't expect everyone to have been to a hackathon before, in fact, we
        love first-time hackers having<br />been there ourselves when we
        started! We're just trying to bring those who most want to really
        build<br />something awesome and learn something new, and while we can't
        invite everyone, we're striving to<br />continue building a community of
        diverse and amazing hackers at PennApps. Just show us what you've<br />made,
        tell us about why you want to be at PennApps, and we'll do our best to
        get you here! Applications<br />are currently open.<br /><br /><br
